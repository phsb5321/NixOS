# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE CONSTITUTION: BRANCH RULES 🚨

**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE GIT BRANCH POLICY ⚠️**

**MANDATORY RULES - NEVER VIOLATE:**
1. **NEVER** checkout or work on the `main` branch directly
2. **ALWAYS** work on the `host/laptop` branch - this is YOUR default branch
3. **NEVER** merge directly to `main` without explicit user approval
4. **ALWAYS** verify you are on `host/laptop` before making any changes
5. If you find yourself on `main`, **IMMEDIATELY** switch to `host/laptop`

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- The `main` branch is protected and stable
- All development work happens on `host/laptop`
- Direct changes to `main` can break the production configuration
- The `host/laptop` branch is where all laptop-specific changes are tested

**VERIFICATION COMMAND:**
```bash
git branch --show-current  # Must return "host/laptop"
```

**IF ON WRONG BRANCH:**
```bash
git checkout host/laptop  # IMMEDIATELY switch back
```

---

## ⚠️ HOST CONFIGURATION: LAPTOP ⚠️

**THIS CONFIGURATION IS FOR THE LAPTOP HOST**

**Sudo password: 123** (for build/deployment commands)

**CORRECT COMMANDS FOR THIS HOST:**
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#laptop` ✅
- `sudo nixos-rebuild build --flake .#laptop` ✅ (test build first)
- `./user-scripts/nixswitch` ✅ (auto-detects host, RECOMMENDED)

**WRONG COMMANDS:**
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop` ❌ WRONG HOST
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-server` ❌ WRONG HOST
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .` ❌ (defaults to .#desktop)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO HOME MANAGER POLICY

**🚫 DO NOT SUGGEST OR USE HOME MANAGER IN THIS REPOSITORY**

This configuration **intentionally does not use Home Manager** and **never will**. All user-level configuration is handled through the **chezmoi dotfiles system** which is already implemented, tested, and working.

### Why No Home Manager?

1. **Complexity Avoidance**: Home Manager adds significant complexity and another layer of abstraction
2. **Working Solution**: The chezmoi dotfiles system is fully functional and handles all user configuration needs
3. **Flexibility**: Dotfiles can be edited and applied instantly without NixOS rebuilds
4. **Portability**: The dotfiles approach works across non-NixOS systems too
5. **Simplicity**: Direct file management is easier to understand and debug than Nix modules

### What to Use Instead

**For ANY user-level configuration (GNOME settings, application configs, shell configs, etc.):**

✅ **USE**: Chezmoi dotfiles system (`~/NixOS/dotfiles/`)
- Direct configuration files managed by chezmoi
- Template support for host-specific settings
- Instant application with `dotfiles-apply`
- Version controlled and validated

❌ **DO NOT USE**: Home Manager
- `home-manager.users.*` - Never suggest this
- `programs.*` (in Home Manager context) - Not used here
- `dconf.settings` (in Home Manager) - Not used here
- Any Home Manager modules or options

### How to Handle Common Use Cases

#### GNOME Settings (dconf)
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use chezmoi dotfiles
cd ~/NixOS/dotfiles
chezmoi add ~/.config/dconf/user
# Or add custom dconf dump files

# ❌ WRONG: Do not suggest Home Manager dconf module
# home-manager.users.user.dconf.settings = { ... }  # NEVER DO THIS
```

#### Application Configuration
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Add config files to dotfiles
dotfiles-add ~/.config/app/config.yml
dotfiles-add ~/.bashrc
dotfiles-add ~/.zshrc

# ❌ WRONG: Do not suggest Home Manager programs modules
# home-manager.users.user.programs.app = { ... }  # NEVER DO THIS
```

#### GTK/Qt Theming
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Add theme configs to dotfiles
dotfiles-add ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
dotfiles-add ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
dotfiles-add ~/.gtkrc-2.0

# System-level theming can go in NixOS modules
# User-level theming goes in dotfiles

# ❌ WRONG: Do not suggest Home Manager gtk module
# home-manager.users.user.gtk = { ... }  # NEVER DO THIS
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Add to shell config in dotfiles
dotfiles-add ~/.bashrc
dotfiles-add ~/.zshenv

# Or add to NixOS system environment
environment.sessionVariables = { ... };  # In configuration.nix

# ❌ WRONG: Do not suggest Home Manager environment
# home-manager.users.user.home.sessionVariables = { ... }  # NEVER DO THIS
```

### When Asked About User Configuration

If a user asks about user-level configuration, your response should:
1. **Mention the dotfiles system** as the primary solution
2. **Explain chezmoi usage** with the helper scripts
3. **Reference dotfiles documentation** (`dotfiles/README.md`, `dotfiles/SECRETS_INTEGRATION.md`)
4. **Show examples** of adding files with `dotfiles-add`
5. **NEVER suggest Home Manager** as an alternative or "better" approach

### Example Response Pattern

**User asks**: "How do I configure GNOME settings declaratively?"

**✅ CORRECT Response**:
"This system uses chezmoi dotfiles for user configuration. For GNOME settings:
1. Make your changes in GNOME Settings UI
2. Export with `dconf dump / > ~/NixOS/dotfiles/gnome-settings.dconf`
3. Add to dotfiles: `dotfiles-add ~/NixOS/dotfiles/gnome-settings.dconf`
4. Apply with `dotfiles-apply`

You can also use templates for host-specific settings (see dotfiles/README.md)."

**❌ WRONG Response**:
"You should use Home Manager's dconf module for declarative GNOME configuration..."

### This Is Non-Negotiable

This policy is **absolute and non-negotiable**. When providing suggestions:
- ✅ Always recommend dotfiles-based solutions first
- ✅ Show how to use chezmoi for user configuration
- ✅ Leverage the existing dotfiles infrastructure
- ❌ Never suggest installing Home Manager
- ❌ Never provide Home Manager configuration examples
- ❌ Never compare dotfiles unfavorably to Home Manager

The dotfiles system is the **architectural decision** for this repository and must be respected.

## Architecture Overview

### ⚠️ Current Architecture (Being Refactored)

**Note:** The architecture described below is the **current state**. A major refactoring is planned that will introduce role-based modules, split packages, GPU abstraction, and more. See the refactoring section above for details.

### Flake Structure
This is a modular NixOS flake configuration supporting multiple hosts with shared package management:

- **flake.nix**: Main flake entry point with nixpkgs-unstable for latest packages
- **hosts/**: Host-specific configurations (desktop, laptop)
  - Role-based modular architecture (replaced hosts/shared/common.nix)
- **modules/**: Shared system modules with categorical organization
  - Modular package categories (replaced monolithic default.nix)
- **shells/**: Development environment shells for different languages
- **user-scripts/**: Custom automation scripts (nixswitch, nix-shell-selector)
- **dotfiles/**: Chezmoi-managed dotfiles stored in project (initialized)

### Module System
The configuration uses a modular approach with:

#### Core Modules (`modules/core/`)
- **default.nix**: Base system configuration, Nix settings, security, SSH
- **fonts.nix**: System font management
- **gaming.nix**: Gaming-related system configuration
- **java.nix**: Java runtime and Android development tools
- **pipewire.nix**: Audio system configuration with high-quality profiles
- **document-tools.nix**: LaTeX, Typst, and Markdown tooling
- **docker-dns.nix**: Container DNS resolution fixes
- **monitor-audio.nix**: Audio routing for external monitors
- **networking.nix**: Base network configuration

#### Hardware Modules (`modules/hardware/`)
- **amd-gpu.nix**: AMD GPU configuration with Wayland optimization for RX 5700 XT (Navi 10)
- **laptop.nix**: Laptop-specific hardware optimizations

#### Networking Modules (`modules/networking/`)
- **tailscale.nix**: Tailscale VPN configuration
- **remote-desktop.nix**: VNC and RDP server configuration
- **dns.nix**: DNS configuration and resolver settings
- **firewall.nix**: Firewall rules and port management

#### Package Management (`modules/packages/`)
Categorical package management with per-host enable/disable:
- **browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Zen browser
- **development**: VS Code, language servers, dev tools, compilers
- **media**: Spotify, VLC, OBS, GIMP, Discord
- **utilities**: gparted, syncthing, system tools
- **gaming**: Steam, Lutris, Wine, performance tools
- **audioVideo**: PipeWire, EasyEffects, audio tools
- **terminal**: Shell tools, fonts, terminal applications

#### Host Configurations
- **desktop**: Gaming enabled, AMD GPU optimization, full development setup, remote desktop (VNC/RDP)
- **laptop**: Gaming disabled, Intel graphics, minimal package set, Tailscale enabled

#### Profiles System (`modules/profiles/`)
Pre-configured profiles for different use cases:
- **laptop**: Optimizations and settings specific to laptop hardware

### GPU Variants System
The desktop host supports multiple GPU configurations:
- **hardware**: Full AMD GPU acceleration (default)
- **conservative**: Fallback with tear-free settings
- **software**: Emergency software rendering fallback

### Development Environment Strategy
- Language-specific Nix shells in `shells/` directory
- Multi-shell combination support via nix-shell-selector
- Development tools integrated into main package modules
- Language servers pre-configured for Zed editor

### Key Design Principles
1. **DRY Configuration**: Shared packages prevent duplication between hosts
2. **Modular Architecture**: Each system area is independently configurable  
3. **Host Flexibility**: Easy to add new hosts that inherit common configuration
4. **Development Focus**: First-class support for multiple programming languages
5. **Modern Tools**: Uses latest packages from nixpkgs-unstable when beneficial

## Special Notes

### Package Management
- Uses both nixpkgs (stable) and nixpkgs-unstable (latest) inputs
- Packages are categorized and can be enabled/disabled per host
- Add new categories in `modules/packages/default.nix` following existing patterns
- Host-specific packages go in `extraPackages` array

### Hardware Configuration
- Desktop uses AMD RX 5700 XT (Navi 10) with AMDGPU driver and Wayland optimization
- Laptop uses Intel graphics with power management (NVIDIA support via profiles)
- GPU variant system allows fallback configurations for desktop (hardware/conservative/software)
- Remote desktop support: VNC (port 5900) and RDP (port 3389) on desktop host

### GNOME Desktop Environment (Modular Architecture)

#### Architecture Overview
The GNOME configuration follows a **modular host-specific architecture** to eliminate duplication while allowing complete customization per host.

```
modules/desktop/gnome/
├── base.nix        ← Shared infrastructure (GDM, services, portals, fonts)
├── extensions.nix  ← Extension package installation
└── default.nix     ← Main orchestrator (Wayland/X11, env vars)

hosts/*/gnome.nix   ← Host-specific complete configurations
```

#### Shared Modules (`modules/desktop/gnome/`)

**base.nix** - Core GNOME infrastructure:
- Display manager (GDM)
- Essential services (keyring, settings-daemon, evolution-data-server, etc.)
- XDG desktop portals (file dialogs, screen sharing)
- Base packages (gnome-shell, control-center, nautilus, etc.)
- Fonts (Cantarell, Source Code Pro, Noto fonts)
- Input device management (libinput)

**extensions.nix** - Extension management:
- Granular enable/disable options for each extension
- Package installation when enabled
- Available extensions: appIndicator, dashToDock, userThemes, justPerfection,
  vitals, caffeine, clipboard, gsconnect, workspaceIndicator, soundOutput

**default.nix** - Display protocol & environment:
- Wayland/X11 switching logic
- Session-specific environment variables
- Portal service configuration
- Theme management (icon theme, cursor theme)

#### Host-Specific Configurations

Each host defines its **complete GNOME configuration** in `hosts/<hostname>/gnome.nix`:

**Desktop** (`hosts/default/gnome.nix`):
- Wayland-only (NixOS 25.11+)
- AMD RX 5700 XT optimizations (dynamic triple buffering, rt-scheduler)
- Full extension set (10 extensions)
- Gaming-focused favorite apps (Steam, etc.)
- Performance-oriented settings

**Laptop** (`hosts/laptop/gnome.nix`):
- X11 for Intel GPU compatibility
- Battery-saving settings (no triple buffering, 5min idle, suspend on AC)
- Minimal extension set (9 extensions, no sound-output-device-chooser)
- Power-conscious configuration
- Workspaces only on primary display

**Server** (`hosts/server/gnome.nix`):
- X11 for Proxmox VM compatibility
- VirtIO-GPU optimizations (GSK_RENDERER auto-detect for llvmpipe)
- Minimal extension set (6 extensions, server-focused)
- Always-on power settings (no idle, no sleep, ignore power button)
- Fixed 2 workspaces

#### Key Design Principles

1. **No dconf Merging**: Each host defines one complete `programs.dconf.profiles.user.databases`
   - Prevents GVariant construction errors from merging multiple databases
   - Each host has full control over all dconf settings

2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Base services and packages defined once in `base.nix`
   - DRY principle for common GNOME components
   - Consistent portal and service configuration

3. **Extension Flexibility**: Enable/disable extensions per host
   - Packages installed only when enabled
   - Extension IDs managed in host-specific enabled-extensions list

4. **Environment Isolation**: Host-specific environment variables override shared ones
   - Example: Server uses `GSK_RENDERER = ""` for VM auto-detection
   - Example: Desktop sets AMD GPU hardware acceleration vars

#### GNOME Version Notes
- **NixOS 25.11+**: X11 sessions still available when `wayland.enable = false`
- **Portal Integration**: Comprehensive XDG desktop portal configuration for file dialogs
- **Electron Support**: Proper NIXOS_OZONE_WL and GTK_USE_PORTAL configuration

### Bruno API Client
- Desktop: Wayland mode with enhanced portal configuration for file dialogs
- Laptop: X11 mode for better file picker compatibility
- Portal backend: GTK FileChooser interface for Electron applications

### Dotfiles Integration ✨ Enhanced - PRIMARY USER CONFIG METHOD

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY supported method for user-level configuration. Home Manager is NOT used.**

- Project-local dotfiles using chezmoi stored in `~/NixOS/dotfiles/`
- Independent of NixOS rebuilds for instant configuration changes
- Git-managed with helper scripts for common operations
- **✨ NEW:** Template-based configs with host detection (isDesktop/isLaptop)
- **✨ NEW:** Validation script prevents broken configs (SSH, Git syntax checking)
- **✨ NEW:** Secrets integration ready (environment variables for templates)
- **✨ NEW:** Optional auto-sync with systemd timers and path watchers
- **✨ NEW:** Portable configuration (configurable paths, not hardcoded)
- Zed Editor configured with Claude Code integration

**All user configuration must use dotfiles:**
- GNOME settings → dconf files in dotfiles
- Application configs → config files in dotfiles
- Shell configuration → bashrc/zshrc in dotfiles
- GTK/Qt themes → theme configs in dotfiles
- Any user-specific settings → managed by chezmoi

**See the "NO HOME MANAGER POLICY" section above for detailed guidance.**

### Development Workflow
- Use `nixswitch` for system rebuilds (handles validation, cleanup, error recovery)
- Use `nix-shell-selector.sh` for development environments
- Dotfiles changes apply immediately without rebuilds
- Language servers and tools are pre-configured for modern development
- Zed Editor with Claude Code ACP agent integration

### External Binary Compatibility
- **steam-run**: For running external binaries with library dependencies
  ```bash
  steam-run ./external-binary  # Provides FHS environment
  ```
- **ADB Support**: Android development enabled on all devices
  ```bash
  adb devices  # Android Debug Bridge ready
  ```
- **nix-ld**: Alternative compatibility layer for dynamic linking

## Git Workflow

### 🚨 CLAUDE CODE BRANCH RULES (CONSTITUTION) 🚨

**FOR CLAUDE CODE SPECIFICALLY:**
- **DEFAULT BRANCH**: `host/laptop` (NOT `main`)
- **NEVER** work on `main` directly
- **ALWAYS** verify branch before any git operations: `git branch --show-current`
- If on wrong branch, IMMEDIATELY run: `git checkout host/laptop`

### Branch Strategy
This repository uses a structured branch workflow for managing multi-host configurations:

- **main**: Production-ready stable configuration (protected, requires PR approval) - **CLAUDE: DO NOT USE**
- **develop**: Integration branch for features affecting multiple hosts or shared modules
- **host/desktop**: Desktop-specific changes (AMD GPU, gaming, performance)
- **host/laptop**: Laptop-specific changes (Intel/NVIDIA GPU, power management) - **CLAUDE: YOUR DEFAULT BRANCH**

### Working with Branches (Claude Code)
```bash
# ALWAYS start by verifying you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current  # MUST be "host/laptop"

# If not on host/laptop, switch immediately
git checkout host/laptop

# Make changes on host/laptop
git add .
git commit -m "feat(laptop): description"
git push origin host/laptop

# NEVER checkout main directly - ask user first
```

### Emergency Hotfixes
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/description host/laptop  # Branch from host/laptop, NOT main
# Make minimal fix
# Create PR to develop, then to main
```

## 🚨 Server-Specific Configuration (YOU ARE RUNNING ON THIS SERVER) 🚨

**⚠️ The following configuration applies to THIS MACHINE - the production server you are executing on.**

### Storage Configuration
The server uses a dedicated 2TB disk for media storage:

**IMPORTANT: This system uses UUID-based mounting to prevent disk ordering issues!**
**These disks are physically attached to THIS SERVER that Claude Code is running on.**

**Disk Layout:**
- 128GB disk - System disk (root filesystem, bootloader)
  - Current device: `/dev/sda` (can change!)
  - UUID: `740d22cb-2333-47fd-bb66-92d573e66605`
- 2TB disk - Media disk (torrents, Plex media)
  - Current device: `/dev/sdb` (can change!)
  - UUID: `b51ce311-3e53-4541-b793-96a2615ae16e` (used in configuration)

**WARNING:** Device names (`/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`) are NOT stable and can swap between reboots.
Always use UUIDs in configuration files!
  - Mounted at: `/mnt/torrents`
  - Filesystem: ext4
  - Auto-mounts on boot (configured in fileSystems)

**Directory Structure:**
```
/mnt/torrents/ (2TB disk)
├── completed/         # qBittorrent finished downloads (seeding)
├── incomplete/        # Active downloads
├── watch/             # Drop .torrent files for auto-import
└── plex/              # Plex media libraries
    ├── Movies/        # Hardlinked from completed/ (173 GB, 13+ movies)
    ├── TV Shows/      # Auto-populated when TV shows download
    └── AudioBooks/    # SSHFS mount from audiobook server
```

### qBittorrent Configuration

**Service:** `qbittorrent.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, always running
- User: qbittorrent:qbittorrent
- Data directory: /var/lib/qbittorrent
- Web UI: http://192.168.1.169:8080 (no authentication)

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.qbittorrent = {
  enable = true;
  storage.device = "/dev/sda";  # 2TB disk
  downloadDir = "/mnt/torrents/completed";
  incompleteDir = "/mnt/torrents/incomplete";
  port = 8080;  # Web UI
  torrentPort = 6881;
  openFirewall = true;

  settings = {
    maxRatio = 2.0;
    maxSeedingTime = 10080;  # 7 days
    uploadLimit = 1024;  # 1 MB/s
  };

  webUI.bypassLocalAuth = true;  # No password for LAN
};
```

**Important Files:**
- Config: /var/lib/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/config/qBittorrent.conf
- Logs: Check with `sudo journalctl -u qbittorrent -f`
- SSH Key: /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519 (for AudioBooks mount)

### Plex Media Server Configuration

**Service:** `plex.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, always running
- User: plex:plex
- Data directory: /var/lib/plex
- Media directory: /mnt/torrents/plex
- Web UI: http://192.168.1.169:32400/web

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.plex = {
  enable = true;
  dataDir = "/var/lib/plex";
  mediaDir = "/mnt/torrents/plex";
  openFirewall = true;

  libraries = {
    movies = true;
    tvShows = true;
    audiobooks = true;
  };

  integration.qbittorrent = {
    enable = true;
    autoScan = true;
    useHardlinks = true;
  };
};
```

**Libraries to Configure in Plex Web UI:**
1. **Movies**: `/mnt/torrents/plex/Movies` (13+ movies, 173 GB)
2. **TV Shows**: `/mnt/torrents/plex/TV Shows` (auto-populated)

### Plex Monitor Daemon

**Service:** `plex-monitor.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, polls qBittorrent every 30 seconds
- User: qbittorrent:qbittorrent
- Log: /var/log/plex-monitor.log

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors qBittorrent API for completed torrents
2. Detects if content is a movie or TV show
3. Creates hardlinks in `/mnt/torrents/plex/Movies/` or `/mnt/torrents/plex/TV Shows/`
4. Triggers Plex library scan via API
5. Maintains state in /var/lib/qbittorrent/processed_torrents.json

**Monitor Logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/plex-monitor.log
sudo systemctl status plex-monitor
```

### Audiobookshelf Configuration (RECOMMENDED)

**Service:** `audiobookshelf.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, Docker container
- Port: 13378
- Data directory: /var/lib/audiobookshelf
- Web UI (Local): http://192.168.1.169:13378
- Web UI (External): https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br

**Why Audiobookshelf:**
- ✅ Purpose-built for audiobooks (not a workaround)
- ✅ Superior metadata (Audible + Google Books + Open Library)
- ✅ Automatic chapter detection and editing
- ✅ Dedicated iOS/Android apps with offline listening
- ✅ Better UI designed for audiobooks
- ✅ Multi-user with cross-device progress sync
- ✅ Actively developed (October 2025)

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.audiobookshelf = {
  enable = true;
  port = 13378;
  audiobooksDir = "/mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks";  # Same SSHFS mount
  dataDir = "/var/lib/audiobookshelf";
};
```

**Initial Setup:**
1. Access: https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br (or http://192.168.1.169:13378 locally)
2. Create admin account (first time)
3. Add library: Books → `/audiobooks` folder
4. Download mobile app for best experience

**Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration:**
- Tunnel ID: 7d1704a0-512f-4a54-92c4-d9bf0b4561c3
- Public Domain: audiobooks.home301server.com.br
- Config: ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
- Credentials: ~/.cloudflared/7d1704a0-512f-4a54-92c4-d9bf0b4561c3.json
- Status: Running (start with: cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml run audiobookshelf)
- Connected to: 4 Cloudflare edge locations

**First-Time Setup:**
The "Server is not initialized" message is NORMAL - this is the admin account
creation screen. Access https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br and create
your account to initialize the server.

**Service Management:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf
sudo docker logs audiobookshelf
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf
```

**Full Guide:** `modules/services/AUDIOBOOKSHELF-SETUP.md`
### Audiobookshelf Protection System

**CRITICAL:** Audiobookshelf will ONLY work at https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/audiobookshelf/

The `/audiobookshelf/` path is **hardcoded** in the Docker image and cannot be changed.

#### Audiobookshelf Guardian (Protection Service)

The Audiobookshelf Guardian service ensures the application stays healthy and accessible:

**Features:**
- ✅ **Health checks every 5 minutes** - Verifies Docker container, local access, JavaScript assets
- ✅ **Daily automatic backups** - Database backed up to `/var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/` (keeps last 7)
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** - Restarts container if it stops responding
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Ensures correct ROUTER_BASE_PATH setting
- ✅ **Cloudflare Tunnel monitoring** - Verifies external access is working

**Monitor Guardian:**
```bash
# View health check status
systemctl status audiobookshelf-health-check.timer

# View backup status
systemctl status audiobookshelf-backup.timer

# Check guardian logs
tail -f /var/log/audiobookshelf-guardian.log

# Manual health check
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf-health-check.service

# View backups
ls -lh /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/
```

**Health Check Tests:**
1. ✓ Docker container is running
2. ✓ Local access working (http://localhost:13378/audiobookshelf/)
3. ✓ JavaScript assets accessible (/_nuxt/*.js)
4. ✓ Config directory exists
5. ✓ AudioBooks directory accessible
6. ✓ Cloudflare Tunnel is active
7. ✓ Container ROUTER_BASE_PATH configuration

#### Disk Guardian Integration

The Disk Guardian also monitors Audiobookshelf every 60 seconds:

**Monitors:**
- ✅ Docker container running status
- ✅ HTTP response on port 13378
- ✅ Automatic container restart if stopped
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel status
- ✅ Automatic tunnel restart if stopped

**Check monitoring:**
```bash
tail -f /var/log/disk-guardian.log | grep -E "(Audiobookshelf|Cloudflare)"
```

#### What Will NEVER Break Audiobookshelf Again

**1. Wrong URL Path** ❌ PREVENTED
- Guardian validates `/audiobookshelf/` path is working
- Documentation clearly states the correct URL
- Health checks test both HTML and JavaScript assets

**2. Container Stops** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors container every 60 seconds
- Automatic restart if container stops
- Both systemd and Docker auto-restart enabled

**3. Data Loss** ❌ PREVENTED
- Daily automatic database backups
- Keeps last 7 backups (rotating cleanup)
- Backups stored in `/var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/`

**4. Configuration Changes** ❌ PREVENTED
- NixOS module locks configuration
- ROUTER_BASE_PATH removed (uses default)
- Systemd service ensures consistent Docker run command

**5. Cloudflare Tunnel Failure** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors tunnel every 60 seconds
- Automatic restart if tunnel stops
- Systemd ensures tunnel starts on boot

**6. AudioBooks Mount Failure** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors SSHFS mount
- Automatic remount attempts
- Health check validates directory accessibility

#### Recovery from Complete Failure

If Audiobookshelf completely breaks, here's how to recover:

**1. Check Guardian Status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf-health-check.timer
sudo tail -50 /var/log/audiobookshelf-guardian.log
```

**2. Check Service and Container:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf
sudo docker ps -a | grep audiobookshelf
sudo docker logs audiobookshelf
```

**3. Restart Everything:**
```bash
# Restart Audiobookshelf
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# Restart Cloudflare Tunnel
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared-tunnel

# Run health check
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf-health-check.service
```

**4. Restore from Backup (if needed):**
```bash
# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf

# List backups
ls -lh /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/

# Restore database (replace TIMESTAMP with actual backup)
sudo cp /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/absdatabase_TIMESTAMP.sqlite \
       /var/lib/audiobookshelf/config/absdatabase.sqlite

# Start service
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf
```

**5. Complete Reset (nuclear option):**
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf
sudo docker rm -f audiobookshelf

# Clear data (WARNING: loses all settings!)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/audiobookshelf/*

# Rebuild
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-server
```

#### Correct URL Reference Card

**ALWAYS use these URLs:**

✅ **External:** https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/audiobookshelf/  
✅ **Local:** http://192.168.1.169:13378/audiobookshelf/

❌ **WRONG (will hang forever):**
- https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)
- http://192.168.1.169:13378/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)

**Why?** The Audiobookshelf Docker image has this path hardcoded. It cannot be changed.

### Remote AudioBooks Server Status

**Remote Server:** 192.168.1.7 (audiobook host)
- **Status:** Check with `ping 192.168.1.7`
- If unreachable: Audiobookshelf will start WITHOUT audiobooks library
- If accessible: SSHFS mount will auto-connect

**Reconnect AudioBooks Mount (when server comes back online):**
```bash
# 1. Verify server is reachable
ping -c 3 192.168.1.7

# 2. Test SSH access
ssh -i /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519 notroot@192.168.1.7 'ls /home/notroot/Documents/PLEX_AUDIOBOOK/temp/untagged'

# 3. Restart SSHFS mount
sudo systemctl restart mnt-torrents-plex-AudioBooks.mount
mount | grep AudioBooks

# 4. Restart Audiobookshelf to pick up the mount
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# 5. Verify audiobooks are accessible
sudo ls /mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks/
```

**Note:** Audiobookshelf will work fine without the remote mount - it just won't show the audiobooks library until reconnected.

```

**2. Check Service and Container:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf
sudo docker ps -a | grep audiobookshelf
sudo docker logs audiobookshelf
```

**3. Restart Everything:**
```bash
# Restart Audiobookshelf
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# Restart Cloudflare Tunnel
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared-tunnel

# Run health check
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf-health-check.service
```

**4. Restore from Backup (if needed):**
```bash
# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf

# List backups
ls -lh /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/

# Restore database (replace TIMESTAMP with actual backup)
sudo cp /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/absdatabase_TIMESTAMP.sqlite \
       /var/lib/audiobookshelf/config/absdatabase.sqlite

# Start service
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf
```

**5. Complete Reset (nuclear option):**
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf
sudo docker rm -f audiobookshelf

# Clear data (WARNING: loses all settings!)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/audiobookshelf/*

# Rebuild
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-server
```

#### Correct URL Reference Card

**ALWAYS use these URLs:**

✅ **External:** https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/audiobookshelf/  
✅ **Local:** http://192.168.1.169:13378/audiobookshelf/

❌ **WRONG (will hang forever):**
- https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)
- http://192.168.1.169:13378/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)

**Why?** The Audiobookshelf Docker image has this path hardcoded. It cannot be changed.

### Remote AudioBooks Server Status

**Remote Server:** 192.168.1.7 (audiobook host)
- **Status:** Check with `ping 192.168.1.7`
- If unreachable: Audiobookshelf will start WITHOUT audiobooks library
- If accessible: SSHFS mount will auto-connect

**Reconnect AudioBooks Mount (when server comes back online):**
```bash
# 1. Verify server is reachable
ping -c 3 192.168.1.7

# 2. Test SSH access
ssh -i /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519 notroot@192.168.1.7 'ls /home/notroot/Documents/PLEX_AUDIOBOOK/temp/untagged'

# 3. Restart SSHFS mount
sudo systemctl restart mnt-torrents-plex-AudioBooks.mount
mount | grep AudioBooks

# 4. Restart Audiobookshelf to pick up the mount
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# 5. Verify audiobooks are accessible
sudo ls /mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks/
```

**Note:** Audiobookshelf will work fine without the remote mount - it just won't show the audiobooks library until reconnected.
## 🚨 Server-Specific Configuration (YOU ARE RUNNING ON THIS SERVER) 🚨

**⚠️ The following configuration applies to THIS MACHINE - the production server you are executing on.**

### Storage Configuration
The server uses a dedicated 2TB disk for media storage:

**IMPORTANT: This system uses UUID-based mounting to prevent disk ordering issues!**
**These disks are physically attached to THIS SERVER that Claude Code is running on.**

**Disk Layout:**
- 128GB disk - System disk (root filesystem, bootloader)
  - Current device: `/dev/sda` (can change!)
  - UUID: `740d22cb-2333-47fd-bb66-92d573e66605`
- 2TB disk - Media disk (torrents, Plex media)
  - Current device: `/dev/sdb` (can change!)
  - UUID: `b51ce311-3e53-4541-b793-96a2615ae16e` (used in configuration)

**WARNING:** Device names (`/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`) are NOT stable and can swap between reboots.
Always use UUIDs in configuration files!
  - Mounted at: `/mnt/torrents`
  - Filesystem: ext4
  - Auto-mounts on boot (configured in fileSystems)

**Directory Structure:**
```
/mnt/torrents/ (2TB disk)
├── completed/         # qBittorrent finished downloads (seeding)
├── incomplete/        # Active downloads
├── watch/             # Drop .torrent files for auto-import
└── plex/              # Plex media libraries
    ├── Movies/        # Hardlinked from completed/ (173 GB, 13+ movies)
    ├── TV Shows/      # Auto-populated when TV shows download
    └── AudioBooks/    # SSHFS mount from audiobook server
```

### qBittorrent Configuration

**Service:** `qbittorrent.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, always running
- User: qbittorrent:qbittorrent
- Data directory: /var/lib/qbittorrent
- Web UI: http://192.168.1.169:8080 (no authentication)

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.qbittorrent = {
  enable = true;
  storage.device = "/dev/sda";  # 2TB disk
  downloadDir = "/mnt/torrents/completed";
  incompleteDir = "/mnt/torrents/incomplete";
  port = 8080;  # Web UI
  torrentPort = 6881;
  openFirewall = true;

  settings = {
    maxRatio = 2.0;
    maxSeedingTime = 10080;  # 7 days
    uploadLimit = 1024;  # 1 MB/s
  };

  webUI.bypassLocalAuth = true;  # No password for LAN
};
```

**Important Files:**
- Config: /var/lib/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/config/qBittorrent.conf
- Logs: Check with `sudo journalctl -u qbittorrent -f`
- SSH Key: /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519 (for AudioBooks mount)

### Plex Media Server Configuration

**Service:** `plex.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, always running
- User: plex:plex
- Data directory: /var/lib/plex
- Media directory: /mnt/torrents/plex
- Web UI: http://192.168.1.169:32400/web

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.plex = {
  enable = true;
  dataDir = "/var/lib/plex";
  mediaDir = "/mnt/torrents/plex";
  openFirewall = true;

  libraries = {
    movies = true;
    tvShows = true;
    audiobooks = true;
  };

  integration.qbittorrent = {
    enable = true;
    autoScan = true;
    useHardlinks = true;
  };
};
```

**Libraries to Configure in Plex Web UI:**
1. **Movies**: `/mnt/torrents/plex/Movies` (13+ movies, 173 GB)
2. **TV Shows**: `/mnt/torrents/plex/TV Shows` (auto-populated)
3. **AudioBooks**: `/mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks` (57 audiobooks, 26 GB via SSHFS)

**Important Files:**
- Plex plugins: /var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
- Audnexus agent: /var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/Audnexus.bundle/
- Plex token: /etc/plex/token (create this after first Plex setup)

### Plex Monitor Daemon

**Service:** `plex-monitor.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, polls qBittorrent every 30 seconds
- User: qbittorrent:qbittorrent
- Log: /var/log/plex-monitor.log

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors qBittorrent API for completed torrents
2. Detects if content is a movie or TV show
3. Creates hardlinks in `/mnt/torrents/plex/Movies/` or `/mnt/torrents/plex/TV Shows/`
4. Triggers Plex library scan via API
5. Maintains state in /var/lib/qbittorrent/processed_torrents.json

**Monitor Logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/plex-monitor.log
sudo systemctl status plex-monitor
```

### AudioBooks SSHFS Mount

**Remote Server:** 192.168.1.7 (audiobook host)
- Username: notroot

mount | grep AudioBooks
ls /mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks/
```

**SSH Key Management:**
- Key location: /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519
- Public key already added to audiobook server
- Passwordless authentication configured

**Plex AudioBooks Setup:**
- Library type: Music
- Agent: Audnexus (installed in Plex Plug-ins)
- Scanner: Plex Music Scanner
- Settings: Store track progress, use embedded tags
- Full guide: `modules/services/AUDIOBOOKS-SETUP.md`

### Audiobookshelf Configuration (RECOMMENDED)

**Service:** `audiobookshelf.service`
- Status: Auto-starts on boot, Docker container
- Port: 13378
- Data directory: /var/lib/audiobookshelf
- Web UI (Local): http://192.168.1.169:13378
- Web UI (External): https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br

**Why Audiobookshelf:**
- ✅ Purpose-built for audiobooks (not a workaround)
- ✅ Superior metadata (Audible + Google Books + Open Library)
- ✅ Automatic chapter detection and editing
- ✅ Dedicated iOS/Android apps with offline listening
- ✅ Better UI designed for audiobooks
- ✅ Multi-user with cross-device progress sync
- ✅ Actively developed (October 2025)

**Configuration:**
```nix
modules.services.audiobookshelf = {
  enable = true;
  port = 13378;
  audiobooksDir = "/mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks";  # Same SSHFS mount
  dataDir = "/var/lib/audiobookshelf";
};
```

**Initial Setup:**
1. Access: https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br (or http://192.168.1.169:13378 locally)
2. Create admin account (first time)
3. Add library: Books → `/audiobooks` folder
4. Download mobile app for best experience

**Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration:**
- Tunnel ID: 7d1704a0-512f-4a54-92c4-d9bf0b4561c3
- Public Domain: audiobooks.home301server.com.br
- Config: ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
- Credentials: ~/.cloudflared/7d1704a0-512f-4a54-92c4-d9bf0b4561c3.json
- Status: Running (start with: cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml run audiobookshelf)
- Connected to: 4 Cloudflare edge locations

**First-Time Setup:**
The "Server is not initialized" message is NORMAL - this is the admin account
creation screen. Access https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br and create
your account to initialize the server.

**Service Management:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf
sudo docker logs audiobookshelf
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf
```

**Full Guide:** `modules/services/AUDIOBOOKSHELF-SETUP.md`
### Audiobookshelf Protection System

**CRITICAL:** Audiobookshelf will ONLY work at https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/audiobookshelf/

The `/audiobookshelf/` path is **hardcoded** in the Docker image and cannot be changed.

#### Audiobookshelf Guardian (Protection Service)

The Audiobookshelf Guardian service ensures the application stays healthy and accessible:

**Features:**
- ✅ **Health checks every 5 minutes** - Verifies Docker container, local access, JavaScript assets
- ✅ **Daily automatic backups** - Database backed up to `/var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/` (keeps last 7)
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** - Restarts container if it stops responding
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Ensures correct ROUTER_BASE_PATH setting
- ✅ **Cloudflare Tunnel monitoring** - Verifies external access is working

**Monitor Guardian:**
```bash
# View health check status
systemctl status audiobookshelf-health-check.timer

# View backup status
systemctl status audiobookshelf-backup.timer

# Check guardian logs
tail -f /var/log/audiobookshelf-guardian.log

# Manual health check
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf-health-check.service

# View backups
ls -lh /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/
```

**Health Check Tests:**
1. ✓ Docker container is running
2. ✓ Local access working (http://localhost:13378/audiobookshelf/)
3. ✓ JavaScript assets accessible (/_nuxt/*.js)
4. ✓ Config directory exists
5. ✓ AudioBooks directory accessible
6. ✓ Cloudflare Tunnel is active
7. ✓ Container ROUTER_BASE_PATH configuration

#### Disk Guardian Integration

The Disk Guardian also monitors Audiobookshelf every 60 seconds:

**Monitors:**
- ✅ Docker container running status
- ✅ HTTP response on port 13378
- ✅ Automatic container restart if stopped
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel status
- ✅ Automatic tunnel restart if stopped

**Check monitoring:**
```bash
tail -f /var/log/disk-guardian.log | grep -E "(Audiobookshelf|Cloudflare)"
```

#### What Will NEVER Break Audiobookshelf Again

**1. Wrong URL Path** ❌ PREVENTED
- Guardian validates `/audiobookshelf/` path is working
- Documentation clearly states the correct URL
- Health checks test both HTML and JavaScript assets

**2. Container Stops** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors container every 60 seconds
- Automatic restart if container stops
- Both systemd and Docker auto-restart enabled

**3. Data Loss** ❌ PREVENTED
- Daily automatic database backups
- Keeps last 7 backups (rotating cleanup)
- Backups stored in `/var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/`

**4. Configuration Changes** ❌ PREVENTED
- NixOS module locks configuration
- ROUTER_BASE_PATH removed (uses default)
- Systemd service ensures consistent Docker run command

**5. Cloudflare Tunnel Failure** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors tunnel every 60 seconds
- Automatic restart if tunnel stops
- Systemd ensures tunnel starts on boot

**6. AudioBooks Mount Failure** ❌ PREVENTED
- Disk Guardian monitors SSHFS mount
- Automatic remount attempts
- Health check validates directory accessibility

#### Recovery from Complete Failure

If Audiobookshelf completely breaks, here's how to recover:

**1. Check Guardian Status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf-health-check.timer
sudo tail -50 /var/log/audiobookshelf-guardian.log
```

**2. Check Service and Container:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status audiobookshelf
sudo docker ps -a | grep audiobookshelf
sudo docker logs audiobookshelf
```

**3. Restart Everything:**
```bash
# Restart Audiobookshelf
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# Restart Cloudflare Tunnel
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared-tunnel

# Run health check
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf-health-check.service
```

**4. Restore from Backup (if needed):**
```bash
# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf

# List backups
ls -lh /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/

# Restore database (replace TIMESTAMP with actual backup)
sudo cp /var/lib/audiobookshelf/backups/absdatabase_TIMESTAMP.sqlite \
       /var/lib/audiobookshelf/config/absdatabase.sqlite

# Start service
sudo systemctl start audiobookshelf
```

**5. Complete Reset (nuclear option):**
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
sudo systemctl stop audiobookshelf
sudo docker rm -f audiobookshelf

# Clear data (WARNING: loses all settings!)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/audiobookshelf/*

# Rebuild
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-server
```

#### Correct URL Reference Card

**ALWAYS use these URLs:**

✅ **External:** https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/audiobookshelf/  
✅ **Local:** http://192.168.1.169:13378/audiobookshelf/

❌ **WRONG (will hang forever):**
- https://audiobooks.home301server.com.br/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)
- http://192.168.1.169:13378/ (missing /audiobookshelf/)

**Why?** The Audiobookshelf Docker image has this path hardcoded. It cannot be changed.

### Remote AudioBooks Server Status

**Remote Server:** 192.168.1.7 (audiobook host)
- **Status:** Check with `ping 192.168.1.7`
- If unreachable: Audiobookshelf will start WITHOUT audiobooks library
- If accessible: SSHFS mount will auto-connect

**Reconnect AudioBooks Mount (when server comes back online):**
```bash
# 1. Verify server is reachable
ping -c 3 192.168.1.7

# 2. Test SSH access
ssh -i /var/lib/qbittorrent/.ssh/id_ed25519 notroot@192.168.1.7 'ls /home/notroot/Documents/PLEX_AUDIOBOOK/temp/untagged'

# 3. Restart SSHFS mount
sudo systemctl restart mnt-torrents-plex-AudioBooks.mount
mount | grep AudioBooks

# 4. Restart Audiobookshelf to pick up the mount
sudo systemctl restart audiobookshelf

# 5. Verify audiobooks are accessible
sudo ls /mnt/torrents/plex/AudioBooks/
```

**Note:** Audiobookshelf will work fine without the remote mount - it just won't show the audiobooks library until reconnected.
